    <h1 style="color: orange;">Finish Well</h1>

    <p>(Hebrews 12:1) Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,</p>

    <p>An athlete might train with weights in preparation for the final match, but no runner, no matter how good they are, will run the final race with ankle and wrist weights on. These things slow the runner down, they cause increased drag and resistance, and when a runner has been bound by extra weight, the moment he takes them off he feels the difference and runs freely. Jesus Christ is looking on, the saints that have gone on before are looking on, the angels are looking on, and when no one else is around you are looking on yourself! At the last day the entire creation will look on, our works will be revealed and tried by fire and the race we have so patiently run will be more than worthwhile.</p>

    <p>Do not grow weary, worn warrior...</p>

    <p>(Ephesians 6:12) For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.</p>

    <p>This olympic event is not a battle lost and won in the realm of the flesh. Many in the struggle start to strive against the wrong things and for the wrong things. Do not grow weary in well doing but conquer evil with good. Like Jacob wrestled with the angel for the blessing, wrestle with the things of God for spiritual blessings, increase, and favor. That is the kind of limp that changes and transforms for the better. When God touches the flesh, He takes away some of our natural strength and replaces it with His supernatural strength. It's so easy to get like Rachel and Leah, it's so easy to get so overly focused on the natural, and what is happening in the natural, and what we want to happen in the natural, and what is not happening in the natural, that we totally miss the supernatual and the true blessings that God has for us.</p>

    <p>5 And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead? 6 He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee, 7 Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again. (Luke 24:5-7)</p>

    <p>Jesus burst out of the tomb and He is running after you! He came out of the grave in resurrection power and He did it all for you! Death could not hold Him, hell could not hold Him, the devil was crushed by Him, and now all life is in Him, through Him and by Him. Life eternal, super abundant, and true is available for whosoever will repent, confess and believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. When He ascended on high, He led captivity captive. When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream. We are full of laughter and singing and the heathen say: The Lord has done great things for them! The Lord has done great things for us! Turn again our captivity O Lord, like the streams in the south.</p>

    <p> 3 And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven: 4 And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? 5 And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. 6 And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do. 7 And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man. 8 And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus. 9 And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink. (Acts 9:3-9)
      He isn't satisfied with your salvation only, He wants to meet, walk and talk with you in the way, He wants to encounter you today in a new way, He wants to knock the opposition in your life down to the ground and He wants you to get back up transformed in His power. What do I do now? I'm blind and I can't see? Fast, pray, and you will be led by the Spirit in the way! There is a deeper realm than is currently seen on the surface, there is increase of revelation, there is a greater manifestation, there are glimpses of glory that eye has not yet seen, available, and ready to be imparted. Christ wants to revel more of Himself and give more of Himself, will you be available and open to receive all that heaven is pouring out and wanting to give?

    <p> 11 I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep. 12 But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep. 13 The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep. 14 I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine. 15 As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep. 16 And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd. (John 10:11-16) <img src="https://thumbnails.creationswap.com/gallery/117/9/117958_1.jpg" class="align-right slide-in"> One scene, two perspectives. One perspective is the unseen, supernatural realm, we might not always see or know when the enemy is in operation but we can see and feel the effects of it. Imagine the hot breath of the invisible predator, ready to devour it's unsuspecting foe. But not far behind, closer than we even think, the good Shepard is fighting on our behalf, on His way to the rescue. Like David in the field, He takes out the lions, the bears, and the giants in our lives when we let Him. The other perspective is the natural realm. The sheep had no say in their rescue but the brothers of David did and Eliab, David's older brother tried with all of His might to derail the plan and purpose of God. If he had succeeded, what would have transpired that day? That was the unseen wolf breathing down the neck of the sheep but the Master was close by and on the way with a mighty deliverance. </p>


    <p>Many men have started well but not completed the race the same way they began and it was almost all for nought. There is not a man alive save the Lord Jesus Chrsit who has not made some kind of mistake, and so it is not about that but it is about the heart.The key difference between a man after God's own heart that slips and falls and someone who is not after God's heart is attitude and posture. Only a Mary can sustain the work that a Martha is trying to do and Jesus says that sitting at His feet is the better part that will not be taken away from those that pursue Him. Supernatural wisdom without the word of God to lead and guide is not sustainable and open rebellion and disobedience to the word of God is disastrous. The wisdom of Solomon was totally corrupted in the end because he was too smart to obey the word and heed the warnings given to him. David was in a tight spot but the worldly wisdom of Ahithophel was overturned because David trusted in God to do it through a chosen vessel. David was a man after God's own heart despite his faults, failures, and weaknesses. He started out with the sheep and the word of God. He held tight to the Lord and His word when on the run from Saul. The first half of David's testimony contains great examples of how to walk, think and waht to do. The second half of David's testimony contains lots of examples of things not to do, not for his condemnation but for our edification. Many kings fell and went astray, and they all got off course because they veered and steered away from God's word, will, and way.</p>

    <p>24 Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain. 25 And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible. 26 I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air: 27 But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway. (1 Cor 9:24-27)
      It's not how fast you start the race, though that may give you a momentary advatange. It's not how fast you run the marathon, but do you endure and make it to the end? It's great to start well but it's even better to finish well. Jesus Christ said on the cross: 'It is finished!' He made it to the end and He finished well as an example of how to walk out of life of faith and finish well. He looked to the Father in heaven to see and hear what He was doing and wanted done. He looked to the word and knew the will of God for His own life. He saw Himself in the word and He wants us to see ourselves in His word too. Not from a Messianic view but as a fully righteous, and holy saint, sanctified in God, by God and for God. We are His vessels, for His Spirit, word, and plan in the earth. He has the blueprint for the ark, He has the blueprint for the temple, He has the blueprint for your life and He wants it to be a living and active reality in your daily life. 7 I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: 8 Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing. (2 Tim 4:7-8)

    <p>I testify to you this day, that the testimony of Christ is the Spirit of prophecy, and that the testator by the name of Jesus has died to nullify the Old and bring in the New Testament. This testament is signed and sealed in blood, enforced by heaven, and is empowered by the Spirit to bring resurrection power, and life eternal. The same Spirit that raised Christ from the dead now lives in you who believe! I testify to all, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand. Hebrews 10:9-13: 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. 10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. 12 For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. 13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved</p>
